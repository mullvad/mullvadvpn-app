# Node gRPC bindings

This package provides JS/TS gRPC bindings generated from our `.proto` files. The bindings are
generated within a Linux container. The bindings consists of two parts:

- The bindings automatically generated from `.proto` files
- A manually index file which exposes the autogenerated bindings

The autogenerated bindings must be regenerated when the source `.proto` files are updated.

## Generate bindings

```bash
npm run build
```

## Build image

Builds the container image which can then be run to generate JS/TS bindings from `.proto` files.
Normally you would only need to do this if you are updating the image.

```bash
cd /desktop
podman build building -t mullvadvpn-app-build-proto-js-ts-bindings
```

## Update image

If changes have been made in the `Dockerfile` or the `scripts` shell scripts then the image should
be [re-built](#build-image) and then pushed to the container repository. After a new image is pushed
to the container repository the hash of the new image should be updated in the
`linux-container-image.txt` file.

_TODO: Add more info on how to actually push the image_
