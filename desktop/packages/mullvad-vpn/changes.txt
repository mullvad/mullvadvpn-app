OpenVPN tunnel protocol support has been removed from the app in favor of WireGuard, which is now the sole tunnel protocol used by the app.
Settings previously located in the WireGuard settings view have been moved into the VPN settings view.
Added support for using port 443 with the UDP-over-TCP anti-censorship method.
