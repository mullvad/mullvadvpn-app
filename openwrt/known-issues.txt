# This is a list of known errors / blockers for running `mullvad-daemon` on OpenWRT

## tun kmod is missing

OpenWRT need to install a kernel module required for creating TUN devices.

Hacky solution: run `opkg install kmod-tun` on the OpenWRT host.

Proper solution: Mark kmod-tun as a dependency in the `mullvad` OpenWRT package.

## Read-only fs

Example log:

```
[2025-10-31 09:56:37.275][mullvad_daemon][ERROR] Error: Unable to get cache dir
Caused by: Failed to create directory /var/cache/mullvad-vpn
Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
````

Hacky solution: create the `/var/cache` directory on the OpenWRT host.

		mkdir -p /var/cache


Proper solution: Allow `mullvad-daemon` to use RAM as a cache storage. Routers are long-running systems anyway.
