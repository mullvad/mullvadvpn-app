  //
  // The VPN server associates the ephemeral peer with the peer who performed the exchange. Any
  // already existing ephemeral peer for the normal peer is replaced. Each normal peer can have
  // at most one ephemeral peer.
  //
  // The ephemeral peer is mutually exclusive to the normal peer. The server keeps both peers in
  // memory, but only one of them is loaded into WireGuard at any point in time. A handshake from
  // the normal peer unloads the corresponding ephemeral peer from WireGuard and vice versa.
  //
  // A new peer is negotiated to avoid a premature break of the tunnel used for negotiation.
  // A tunnel would break prematurely if configuration such as preshared key were applied before the
  // normal peer received the server's response. This cannot occur now because the client decides
  // when to switch to the ephemeral tunnel. This design also allows the client to switch back to
  // using a non-ephemeral tunnel at any point.
  //
  // The server gives no guarantees how long the ephemeral peer will be valid and working when it's
  // no longer in use. The client should negotiate a new ephemeral peer every time it establishes a
  // new tunnel to the server.
  //
  // The request from the VPN client should contain:
  //   * `wg_parent_pubkey` - The public key used by the current tunnel (that the request travels
  //     inside).
  //   * `wg_ephemeral_peer_pubkey` - A newly generated ephemeral WireGuard public key for the
  //     ephemeral peer. The server will associate the new configuration with this key.
  //   * One or more requests for different types of options. See the individual messages for more
  //     information. If a request is provided, a corresponding response may be returned in the
  //     server's response.

  // the entropy in the PSK is uniformly distributed. The actual keys used for encrypting the
  // data channel will have uniformly distributed entropy anyway, thanks to the HKDF.
  //
  // KEMs that produce shared secrets of other lengths than 32 bytes, should hash the shared
  // secret with sha256 to generate the 32 bytes used in the XOR step.

  // Mixing with XOR (A = B ^ C) is fine since nothing about A is revealed even if one of B or C
