                DAITA (Defence against AI-guided Traffic Analysis) hides patterns in your encrypted VPN traffic. \
                If anyone is monitoring your connection, this makes it significantly harder for them to identify \
                what websites you are visiting. It does this by carefully adding network noise and making all \
                network packets the same size.
                Attention: Since this increases your total network traffic, \
                be cautious if you have a limited data plan. \
                It can also negatively impact your network speed and battery usage.
