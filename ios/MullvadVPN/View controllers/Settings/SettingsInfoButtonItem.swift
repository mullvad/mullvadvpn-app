                DAITA (Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis) hides patterns in your encrypted VPN traffic. \
                If anyone is monitoring your connection, this makes it significantly harder for them to identify \
                what websites you are visiting.
                It does this by carefully adding network noise and making all network packets the same size.
                Not all our servers are DAITA-enabled. Therefore, we use multihop automatically to enable DAITA \
                with any server.
                Attention: Be cautious if you have a limited data plan as this feature will increase your network \
                traffic. This feature can only be used with WireGuard.

                By enabling “Direct only” you will have to manually select a server that is DAITA-enabled. \
                This can cause you to end up in a blocked state until you have selected a compatible server \
                in the “Select location” view.
