/**
 Task-based FIFO queue used by `PacketTunnelActor`.

 A task is a unit of asynchronous work. A task can be comprised of multiple async calls. The purpose of `TaskQueue` is to make sure that individual tasks can
 execute their work in a transactional fashion without interlacing or interrupting each others work. You can think of it as a simplified `OperationQueue` for
 coroutines.

 `TaskQueue` also implements a basic relationship management between tasks in form of cancelling adjacent tasks that otherwise undo each others work, such as
 for instance a call to `.stop` is guaranteed to undo work of any preceding task. (See `TaskKind` for more information)
