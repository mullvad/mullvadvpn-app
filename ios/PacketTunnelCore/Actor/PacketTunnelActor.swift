/**
 Packet tunnel state machine implemented as an actor.

 - Actor receives commands for execution over the `CommandChannel`.

 - Commands are consumed in a detached task via for-await loop over the channel. Each command, once received, is executed in its entirety before the next
   command is processed. See the implementation of `consumeCommands()` which is the central task dispatcher inside of actor.

 - Most of calls that actor performs suspend for a very short amount of time. `CommandChannel` proactively discards unwanted tasks as they arrive to prevent
   future execution, such as repeating commands to reconnect are coalesced and all commands prior to stop are discarded entirely as the outcome would be the
   same anyway.
