/**
 Packet tunnel state machine implemented as an actor.

 - Actor receives events for execution over the `EventChannel`.

 - Events are consumed in a detached task via for-await loop over the channel. Each event, once received, is executed in its entirety before the next
   event is processed. See the implementation of `consumeEvents()` which is the central task dispatcher inside of actor.

 - Most of calls that actor performs suspend for a very short amount of time. `EventChannel` proactively discards unwanted tasks as they arrive to prevent
   future execution, such as repeating commands to reconnect are coalesced and all events prior to stop are discarded entirely as the outcome would be the
   same anyway.
