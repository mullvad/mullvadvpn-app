/**
 Tunnel actor state with metadata describing the current phase of packet tunnel lifecycle.

 ## General lifecycle

 Packet tunnel always begins in `.initial` state and ends `.disconnected` state over time. Packet tunnel process is not recycled and hence once
 the `.disconnected` state is reached, the process is terminated. The new process is started next time VPN is activated.

 ```
 .initial → .connecting → .connected → .disconnecting → .disconnected
 ```

 ## Reconnecting state

 `.reconnecting` can be entered from `.connected` state.

 ```
 .connected → .reconnecting -> .connected
 .reconnecting → .disconnecting → .disconnected
 ```

 ## Error state

 `.error` can be entered from nearly any other state except when the tunnel is at or past `.disconnecting` phase.

 A call to reconnect the tunnel while in error state can be used to attempt the recovery and exit the error state upon success.
 Note that actor decides the target state when transitioning from `.error` state forward based on state prior to error state.

 ```
 .error → .reconnecting
 .error → .connecting
 ```

 ### Packet tunnel considerations

 Packet tunnel should raise `NEPacketTunnelProvider.reasserting` when `reconnecting` but not when `connecting` since
 `reasserting = false` always leads to `NEVPNStatus.connected`.

 ## Interruption

 `.connecting`, `.reconnecting`, `.error` can be interrupted if the tunnel is requested to stop, which should segue actor towards `.disconnected` state.
