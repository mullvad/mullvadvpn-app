 Public methods for dispatching commands to Actor.

 - All methods in this extension are `nonisolated` because the channel they use to pass commands for execution is `nonisolated` too.
 - FIFO order is guaranteed for all these calls for as long as they are not invoked simulatenously from multiple concurrent queues.
 - There is no way to wait for these tasks to complete, some of them may even be coalesced and never execute. Observe the `state` to follow the progress.
