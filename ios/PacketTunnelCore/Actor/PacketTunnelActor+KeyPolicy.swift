     Cache WG active key for a period of time, before switching to using the new one stored in settings.

     This function replaces the key policy to `.usePrior` caching the currently used key in associated value.

     That cached key is used by actor for some time until the new key is propagated across relays. Then it flips the key policy back to `.useCurrent` and
     reconnects the tunnel using new key.

     The `lastKeyRotation` passed as an argument is a simple marker value passed back to UI process with actor state. This date can be used to determine when
     the main app has to re-read device state from Keychain, since there is no other mechanism to notify other process when packet tunnel mutates keychain store.

     - Parameter lastKeyRotation: date when last key rotation took place.
