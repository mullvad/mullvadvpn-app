/**
 Sync-to-async ordered coalescing channel with unbound buffering.

 Publishers send commands over the channel to pass work to consumer. Received commands are buffered, until requested by consumer and coalesced just
 before consumption.

 - Multiple consumers are possible but the actor is really expected to be the only consumer.
 - Internally, the channel acquires a lock, so you can assume FIFO ordering unless you publish values simultaneously from multiple concurrent queues.

 ### Example

 ```
 let channel = CommandChannel()
 channel.send(.stop)
 ```

 Consuming commands can be implemented using a for-await loop. Note that using a loop should also serialize the command handling as the next command will not
 be consumed until the body of the loop completes the iteration.

 ```
 Task.detached {
     for await command in channel {
        await handleMyCommand(command)
     }
 }
 ```

 Normally channel is expected to be infinite, but it's convenient to end the stream earlier, for instance when testing the coalescing algorithm:

 ```
 channel.send(.start(..))
 channel.send(.stop)
 channel.sendEnd()

 let allReceivedCommands = channel
     .map { "\($0)" }
     .reduce(into: [String]()) { $0.append($1) }
 ```
