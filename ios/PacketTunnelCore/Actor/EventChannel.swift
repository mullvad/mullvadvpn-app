/**
 Sync-to-async ordered coalescing channel with unbound buffering.

 Publishers send events over the channel to pass work to consumer. Received events
 are buffered, until requested by consumer and coalesced just before consumption.

 - Multiple consumers are possible but the actor is really expected to be the only consumer.
 - Internally, the channel acquires a lock, so you can assume FIFO ordering unless you publish values simultaneously from multiple concurrent queues.

 ### Example

 ```
 let channel = EventChannel()
 channel.send(.stop)
 ```

 Consuming events can be implemented using a for-await loop. Note that using a loop should also serialize the event handling as the next event will not
 be consumed until the body of the loop completes the iteration.

 ```
 Task.detached {
     for await event in channel {
        await handleMyEvent(event)
     }
 }
 ```

 Normally channel is expected to be infinite, but it's convenient to end the stream earlier, for instance when testing the coalescing algorithm:

 ```
 channel.send(.start(..))
 channel.send(.stop)
 channel.sendEnd()

 let allReceivedEvents = channel
     .map { "\($0)" }
     .reduce(into: [String]()) { $0.append($1) }
 ```
