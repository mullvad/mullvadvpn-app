            is selected and excluded from the list of multiple relays.
         3. Exit constraint matches multiple relays and the other a single relay. The single relay
            is selected and excluded from the list of multiple relays.
         4. Both entry and exit constraints match multiple relays. Exit relay is picked first and then
