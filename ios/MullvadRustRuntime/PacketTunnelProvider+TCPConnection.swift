/// End sequence of an ephemeral peer exchange.
///
/// This FFI function is called by Rust when an ephemeral peer negotiation succeeded or failed.
/// When both the `rawPresharedKey` and the `rawEphemeralKey` are raw pointers to 32 bytes data arrays,
/// the quantum-secure key exchange is considered successful.
/// If the `rawPresharedKey` is nil, but there is a valid `rawEphemeralKey`, it means a Daita peer has been negotiated with.
/// If `rawEphemeralKey` is nil, the negotiation is considered failed.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - rawEphemeralPeerReceiver: A raw pointer to the running instance of `NEPacketTunnelProvider`
///   - rawPresharedKey: A raw pointer to the quantum-secure pre shared key
///   - rawEphemeralKey: A raw pointer to the ephemeral private key of the device
