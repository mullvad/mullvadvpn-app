// There's currently no test for migrating from V2 (RelayConstraint<RelayLocations>) to
// V3 (RelayConstraint<UserSelectedLocations>) due to the only part being changed was an
// optional property. Even if the stored version is V2, the decoder still matches the
// required property of V3 and then disregards the optional, resulting in a successful
// migration. This doesn't affect any end users since during V2 there was no way to
// access the affected features from a release build.
