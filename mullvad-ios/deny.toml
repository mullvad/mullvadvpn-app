# This file is for an additional check to prevent GPL-3.0 licensed crates
# from being introduced into the iOS app's Rust dependency tree, due to
# App Store restrictions.
# It does not override the main deny.toml file and needs to be run separately.
# See .github/workflows/rust-supply-chain.yml for the workflow that runs this check.
