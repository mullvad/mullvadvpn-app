CHANGE THIS BEFORE A RELEASE
Each line is treated as a separate change item shown in the GUI the first time it runs after install.
Start each line with a capital letter and end each line with a period.
[macOS, Windows, linux] To make an entry platform specific, start the line with an angle bracket enclosed comma separated list of platforms to show the entry on.
Only point out the major changes.
