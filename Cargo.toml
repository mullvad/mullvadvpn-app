# FIXME: This is here as a temporary hack to stop the mullvad-daemon from segfaulting
# on Windows. Can hopefully be removed after we have replaced OpenSSL with Rustls.
# https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/1438
# Other opt-levels that stops the daemon from crashing include 0 and 1. Crashes has
# only been detected on 2.
