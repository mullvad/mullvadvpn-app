- Added support for multihop which allows routing traffic through an entry location to an exit location.
- Added support for using DAITA with locations lacking DAITA support by automatically routing the traffic via a DAITA enabled location. This behaviour can be disabled using the "Direct only" setting.
- Updated DAITA to v2 which supports flexible configuration.
