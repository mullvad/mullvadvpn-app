# Audits, pentests and external security reviews

Independent audits help to discover potential security vulnerabilities and fix them, all resulting
in an even better service. It also gives you the opportunity to judge whether or not we are
technically competent enough to provide a service in which security is paramount.

We perform these external security audits every two years. Here are all the audits we have
performed on this app so far:
