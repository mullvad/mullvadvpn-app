# 2024-12-10 - X41 D-Sec security assessment of the Mullvad VPN app

Four people from [X41 D-Sec](https://x41-dsec.de/) (also referred to as just X41 in this document)
performed a penetration test and source code audit of the Mullvad VPN app for a
total of 30 person-days between 2024-10-23 and 2024-11-28.
The audit report was handed over to Mullvad on 2024-11-30.

The security assessment included all five supported platforms, and they were audited
at the following versions respectively:

* Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS) - [2024.6](../CHANGELOG.md#20246---2024-10-23)
* iOS - [2024.8](../ios/CHANGELOG.md#20248---2024-10-14)
* Android - [2024.8-beta1](../android/CHANGELOG.md#android20248-beta1---2024-10-21)


Quoting the key conclusions of the report:

> A total of six vulnerabilities were discovered during the test by X41. None were rated as having
a critical severity, three as high, two as medium, and one as low. Additionally, three issues
without a direct security impact were identified.

> Overall, the Mullvad VPN Application appear to have a high security level and are well
positioned to protect from the threat model proposed in this report. The use of safe coding and
design patterns in combination with regular audits and penetration tests led to a very hardened
environment.

> In conclusion, the client applications exposed a limited number of relevant vulnerabilities.
Mullvad VPN AB addressed them swiftly and the fixes were audited to be working properly.

## Focus areas of audit

The goal of the audit was to identify issues in the app that might affect the security
or privacy of the user. In other words, to ensure that the app protects the user as
described in the threat model we agreed upon together with X41. See chapter
*2.1 Threat Model* in the report for details.

The main focus areas where we asked X41 to spend most of their time included:

* Can an outside attacker learn parts of the user identity, or cause the device to leak traffic?
* Can an outside attacker cause the VPN application to crash or otherwise malfunction?
* Can a low-privileged local user use the Mullvad VPN app as a vector to escalate privileges?

## Read the report

The audit report was first delivered to Mullvad on 2024-11-30. It was a really good report
as is, but together with X41 we identified some sentences which were slightly unclear.
X41 then handed us a revised final report on 2024-12-10. Both versions are hosted on X41's
website:
* [2024-11-30 first version](https://www.x41-dsec.de/static/reports/X41-Mullvad-Audit-Final-Report-2024-11-18.pdf)
* [2024-12-10 final version](https://www.x41-dsec.de/static/reports/X41-Mullvad-Audit-Public-Report-2024-12-10.pdf)

We host both versions of the report in this repository:
* [2024-11-30-X41-D-Sec-Audit-Report-v1.pdf](./2024-11-30-X41-D-Sec-Audit-Report-v1.pdf)
* [2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec-Audit-Report-v2.pdf](./2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec-Audit-Report-v2.pdf)

## Overview of findings

This chapter will present a summary of each finding along with Mullvad's response to them.
For more details about the finding, please read the report.

A total of six vulnerabilities were discovered during the test by X41. None were rated as
having a critical severity, three as high, two as medium, and one as low.
Additionally, three issues without a direct security impact were identified.

Mullvad implemented fixes for four of the issues during the audit, and released a new version
of the app on the affected platforms around the time when we were handed the final audit report.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-01__: Signal Handler Alternate Stack Too Small
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-01"></a>

The alternative stack configured for the fault signal handler in `mullvad-daemon` was too small.
Since there were no guard page or other stack overrun protections in place, this could lead to
the signal handler reading and writing beyond the allocated stack, leading to potential heap
corruption and undefined behavior. This affected Android, Linux and macOS.

We fixed this by just not setting up an alternative stack at all for our fault signal handler.
These changes were done first in [PR #7137] and later updated in [PR #7172].
The signal handler will now run on the default stack, or the altstacks set up by Rust and Go.
All of which guard against stack overflows.

The fix for this issue is included in version [`2024.8`] for desktop and version
[`2024.9-beta1`] for Android. These versions were released just as the audit was completed.

We agree with the conclusion from X41 that this vulnerability is not trivial to exploit, but if
exploited it would be severe. Due to the low exploitability and the fact that this issue has
been present for multiple years without any practical issues surfacing, we decided to not
immediately mark existing apps as unsupported, but to release a fixed app version as soon
as the audit was complete. We still recommend users on the affected platforms to
upgrade to the latest version of the app at their earliest convenience.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-02__: Signal Handler Uses Non-Reentrant Safe Functions
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-02"></a>

The fault signal handler in `mullvad-daemon` called functions which are not signal
safe. This could cause undefined behavior, or worst case, be exploitable if the attacker
was able to control enough of the program state and externally trigger a fault.
This affected Android, Linux and macOS.

More specifically, the signal handler had code which caused heap allocations. This included
log string formatting and obtaining backtraces.
A good description of [signal safety] can be found on the man page.

We fixed this by re-implementing the signal logging using only signal safe code, and by not
using the `log` Rust crate. We were not able to make backtrace rendering signal safe, but
we still wanted the backtraces in debug builds. So we decided to keep the unsafe backtrace code,
but disable it by default. Backtrace logging can be enabled by explicitly setting
`MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT=1`, or by compiling the program with debug assertions.

The fix for this issue is included in version [`2024.8`] for desktop and version
[`2024.9-beta1`] for Android. These versions were released just as the audit was completed.

We are not aware of any way to maliciously or accidentally exploit or trigger this bug. This bug
has been around for multiple years without any practical issues surfacing. So just like for
`MLLVD-CR-24-01` above, we decided to not release any quick patch release immediately, but instead
wait for the audit to finish and release fixes for all audit findings at the same time.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-03__: Virtual IP Address of Tunnel Device Leaks to Network Adjacent Participant
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-03"></a>

The Linux kernel (and consequently Android) by default replies to ARP requests for any local
target IP address, configured on any interface. This allows a network adjacent
attacker (same local network) to learn the IP address of the VPN tunnel interface by
sending an ARP request for every private IPv4 address to the device.

This can be used by an adversary on the same local network to make a qualified guess if the device
is using Mullvad VPN. Furthermore, since the in-tunnel IP only changes monthly, the adversary can
also possibly identify a device over time.

Linux and Android are the only affected operating systems. All other platforms we support only
respond to ARP requests if the target IP is assigned to the interface where the ARP
request arrives.

On Linux we solved the issue by changing the kernel parameter [`net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore`]
to `2` whenever a VPN tunnel is established. This change was done in [PR #7141] and is included
in the desktop app release version [`2024.8`].

Android apps, including Mullvad VPN, do not have the permission to change kernel parameters such as
`arp_ignore`. All Android devices that we know of are affected, as it is the default behavior of the
OS. We have reported this issue [upstream to Google], and recommended that they change the kernel
parameter to prevent the device from disclosing the VPN tunnel IP to the local network in this way.
See the report for more details. We have added this Android issue to our document of [known issues].

We don't consider this a high severity leak since the in-tunnel IP does not disclose a lot about
the user. The IP is also automatically rotated every month, only making it a temporary identifier.
However, Android users that are worried can log out and back in to the app, as this gives them
a new tunnel IP.
We are working on solutions that stops the in-tunnel IP from remaining the same over time.
When this has been deployed, the issue will be gone on Android also.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-04__: Deanonymization Through NAT
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-04"></a>

All UDP connections from a client to some service on the internet have a corresponding entry in the
NAT table on the exit VPN relay the client is using. If a UDP packet arrives at the exit IP
of the VPN relay with the source IP and port matching the peer internet service, and the
destination port matches the random port assigned to the connection in the NAT table,
then the relay will forward the packet in the tunnel, to the client.
An attacker who can both spoof UDP source addresses and observe the client's tunnel traffic,
can learn if the client is talking to a specific service or not.
They can do this by sending packets of a specific size, and observe tunnel packets of that size
(plus VPN tunnel header size) being sent to the client. Or they can send floods of packets and
observe the volume of VPN traffic to the client increase. This affects all platforms and versions
of the app.

The attack would be hard to carry out. First of all the attacker would need to be able to send UDP
packets with spoofed source IPs. Many network providers prevent this, but not all of them.
The attacker would also need to be able to observe the client's tunnel traffic. On top
of this, the attacker would also need to send large volumes of data to carry out the attack.
If the attacker knows what VPN server IP address the client exits through, they would need to send
tens of thousands of packets before hitting the correct destination port, that match the
relay's NAT table entry. Since every Mullvad relay has multiple exit IPs, and each client is
assigned a random IP, the attacker would need to figure out what exit IPs the relay has,
and repeat the above brute force method on all of them. Moreover, if the client uses
multihop, the attacker can't easily infer what exit VPN relay the client uses. The attacker
must then perform the above brute force attack against every exit IP of every Mullvad relay.
All of this must be carried out in the somewhat short amount of time that the NAT table entry
is active on the relay, meaning a time window of just a few minutes around when the client device
communicates with the internet service.

This issue is not specific to the Mullvad VPN service or our app. This is a general flaw in UDP.
Since UDP is becoming a more common and important protocol due to http/3 and similar,
Mullvad would love if it became the norm that all network providers performed UDP source address
validation, as it would mitigate issues like this to a large extent.

The [DAITA] feature can mitigate this attack to some extent. Since all packets are padded to the
same size, and extra noise packets are injected, it becomes harder for the attacker to
detect when their probing packet is forwarded to the client.

Mullvad does not plan to actively mitigate this issue further in the app. The attack is already
hard to carry out, and can be prevented further by enabling multihop and/or DAITA.
Concerned users can also choose to avoid using UDP to communicate with sensitive services.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-05__: Deanonymization Through MTU
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-05"></a>

This attack is about how an attacker that can both observe a user’s tunnel traffic and also
manipulate internet traffic en route to the exit VPN relay of the user can potentially
deanonymize the user. By adjusting the MTU of the traffic, delaying or dropping packets
or cause traffic bursts in connections outside the tunnel, they can observe if the same
traffic patterns occur on the encrypted tunnel traffic.
With this information they can potentially infer if the connections belong to the
user of the observed tunnel or not.

Attacks like these are not specific to Mullvad VPN. The attack simply relies on core
internet functionality and pattern matching. The threat model defined in the report makes
it clear that a too powerful attacker who can observe and manipulate internet traffic
on a global scale is virtually impossible to fully protect against.

[DAITA] mitigates this attack to some extent by padding all packets to the same size
and injecting noise in the tunnel. This makes it significantly harder for the
attacker to detect the pattern they created in the tunnel.

Mullvad's multihop feature makes this attack harder to carry out. Multihop hides
the client's real IP from the exit VPN relay. If the attacker can observe and control traffic
in and out of the exit VPN relay, they can perform the above attack. But if the client
is using multihop, the attacker cannot see the real IP of the client. The attacker can
deduce which entry VPN relay the client likely connects via, but they must then
also be able to observe all traffic in and out of the entry VPN relay to find the IP
of the client. Preventing attacks like these was one of the reasons why multihop
was introduced, and is why Mullvad recommends using entry and exit relays from different
hosting providers for the best protection.

We think this kind of attack is not in the threat model of most users.
However, we encourage everyone to consider their own situation and decide what they
need to protect against.

We agree with the severity rating being set to *low* on this issue, since it requires a powerful
attacker and only provide them with heuristics to make qualified guesses about who the client is.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-06__: Windows installer runs adjacent taskkill.exe
<a id="MLLVD-CR-24-06"></a>

The Windows installer for the Mullvad VPN app invokes `taskkill.exe` in some places to kill
processes as part of the install/upgrade procedure. Some of these invocations did not
use absolute paths to the binary. This made Windows prefer any binary with that name,
placed in the working directory (the directory where the installer is executed from)
over the `taskkill.exe` shipped with the system. This issue only affects Windows.

If the user was tricked into placing a malicious binary named `taskkill.exe` in the same directory
as the Mullvad VPN app installer, the installer would execute the malicious code. Most installers
are likely executed from the web browser's default download directory. This is also where
any `taskkill.exe` file would end up, if the user had previously been tricked
into downloading such file. Combining these facts makes the vulnerability not too unlikely or
hard to carry out.

Since the installer runs with administrator privileges, this vulnerability allows for
privilege escalation. Given the impact of a compromise, and how relatively easy it is
to trigger, we agree with the severity rating of *high*.

The fix for this was to always specify the absolute path to `taskkill.exe`. This fix was
made to the app in [PR #7225] and merged the same day the vulnerability was reported to us.

The fix was released in version [`2024.8`]. Since the vulnerability only exists in the installer,
and not the actual VPN application, we decided to not mark existing apps as unsupported or
vulnerable. An already installed app is not affected by this.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-100__: Publisher Not Set on Windows uninstaller

The app's uninstaller binary for Windows has no publisher information set. This cause Windows
to ask the user if they want to allow a program from an "Unknown publisher" to make changes
to their system.

This is not technically unsafe in any way, but it looks bad and can make the user doubt the
authenticity of the application. If ignoring system warnings like this becomes the norm
among users, it becomes easier to perform phishing attacks against them.
We want users to pay attention to details around publisher signatures and identities as it makes
them more resilient against phishing attempts and other malicious programs.

We have started looking into adding proper publisher information to our uninstaller.

### __MLLVD-CR-24-101__: Binary Hardening

The third party tool [`binary-security-check`] reports that some of the binaries shipped
with the Windows version of our app is missing some potential hardening. This does not
constitute a direct security risk, nor indicate the presence of bugs in the software.
This just means we have not enabled all possible techniques to prevent
hypothetical present or future bugs from turning into exploitable security risks.

We have started looking into what would be required for us to enable these
binary hardening techniques and how much practical benefit it would be for our users.

[`binary-security-check`]: https://github.com/koutheir/binary-security-check

### __MLLVD-CR-24-102__: IOCTL Unrestricted Kernel Pool Memory Allocation

The split tunneling kernel driver on Windows allowed the `mullvad-daemon` (and
by extension any low-privileged process) to add an unrestricted number of processes
to the list of processes excluded from the tunnel. This can cause system stability issues,
since the kernel can end up allocating a lot of the available memory.

This does not constitute a security risk (potential system instability not counted).
As described in our [security documentation], the Mullvad app assumes all software and
users on the local machine are trusted and not malicious. Any user is allowed to disable
the VPN. This is by design and has been the case since the first version of the app.

We will be updating the code to restrict the number of excluded processes to mitigate this
issue. No special release will be made with just this fix, since it's not a problematic bug.
The fix should be included in the next split tunnel driver version.

## Last words

Mullvad is very happy with the quality of the audit performed by X41 D-Sec.
The fact that they found soundness issues in code that has existed since
before the last two audits shows that it's worth using different audit companies
for each audit. This is not meant as criticism against the previous audit companies.
The app is too big to realistically look into every aspect and detail in a few weeks.
We have always had the explicit tactic to use a different third
party auditor for every audit, to get different sets of eyes from people with different
skills and mindsets every time.

We would like to thank X41 D-Sec for their great security assessment and the nice
collaboration we have had with you during the planning and execution stages of the audit.
