## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Integrate initial Shadowsocks proxy support. Accessible via CLI.

### Fixed
- Fix the potential reconnect loop in GUI, triggered by the timeout when receiving
  the initial state of the daemon.
- Fix the bug which caused the account token history to remain stale after logout.
- Fix some notifications not appearing depending on how the window is shown and hidden while the
  tunnel state changes.
- Fix DNS when using IPv6.

#### Linux
- Fix startup failure when network device with a hardware address that's not a MAC address is
  present.

#### Windows
- Improve error handling related to DNS management at the time of establishing the tunnel.

### Changed
#### Linux
- Increase `NetworkManager` DBus RPC timeout from 1 second to 3 seconds.
- Improve notification look by adding application name and icon.


## [2019.1] - 2019-01-29
This release is identical to 2019.1-beta1


## [2019.1-beta1] - 2019-01-25
### Added
- Handle "block when disconnected" extra kill-switch level in the GUI, showing the disconnected
  state as blocked when appropriate and also having a toggle switch for the setting in the Advanced
  Settings screen.
- Add a drop-down warning to notify the user when the account credits are running low.
- Allow the 169.254.0.0/16 private network in addition to the other networks allowed when local
  network sharing is enabled.
- Improve the confirmation dialog when submitting a bug report without an email specified.

#### macOS
- Add a monochromatic tray icon option for the GUI.

#### Linux
- Detect if the computer is offline. If so, don't sit in a reconnect loop, instead block and show
  an error message.
- Add a toggle switch to allow the app to start minimized on Linux, so that only the tray icon is
  initially visible.

### Changed
- Disable buttons and menus that open external links when the app knows that there is no internet
  connection.
- The auto-start and auto-connect toggles in the GUI have been reworked so that auto-connect
  configures the GUI to automatically connect when it starts and so that it will only auto-connect
  on boot when both settings are set.

### Fixed
- Stop GUI from glitching during the short reconnect state.
- Dismiss notifications automatically after four seconds in all platforms.
- Fix error printed from the CLI when issuing `relay update`.
- Fix relay list update interval. Should now handle sleep better.
- Prevent GUI from sending connect commands to the daemon every time it establishes a connection to
  it. Only send connect once (if auto-connect is enabled.)
- Prevent possible reconnect loop where the GUI would indefinitely reconnect to the daemon.
- Fix the bug which enabled users to return to the login view if they went to settings while
  logging in.
- Handle in the GUI, if something external changes the account token in the daemon. I.e. triggered
  by CLI unsetting or resetting it.

#### Linux
- Fix Debian package not upgrading properly due to a bug in the post-remove script.
- Wait for NetworkManager and systemd-resolved services to start before daemon starts on platforms
  with systemd and those two services. Prevents the daemon from using the wrong DNS API.

#### Windows
- Gracefully block when TAP adapter is missing or disabled, instead of retrying to connect.

### Security
#### Linux
- Poll netfilter to verify firewall rules were added correctly. On Ubuntu 14.04 netfilter did not
  return any error, but it also ignored the rules the daemon tried to add.


## [2018.6] - 2018-12-12
This release is identical to 2018.6-beta1


## [2018.6-beta1] - 2018-12-05
### Added
- CLI command `relay update` that triggers an update of the relay list in the daemon.
- Add extra level of kill-switch called "block when disconnected". Blocks all network traffic even
  in the disconnected state. Not activated by default and can be changed via the CLI subcommand
  `block-when-disconnected`.
- Ability to debug firewall rules on macOS with the `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` variable.

#### macOS
- Detect if the computer is offline. If so, don't sit in a reconnect loop, instead block and show
  an error message.

#### Windows
- Install tray icon in visible part of the notification area.

### Changed
- Split DNS management from Firewall management to allow restoring DNS earlier and showing more
  detailed errors to users.

### Fixed
- Cancel pending system notifications when the app becomes visible.
- Transition to connected state after all routes are configured. Avoids problems with reaching the
  internet directly after the app says it's connected.
- Disable keep alive on API RPC requests. Should stop reuse of invalid sockets after tunnel state
  changes.

#### macOS
- Fix permissions on log dir so problem-report tool has permission to read daemon logs.

#### Windows
- Use proper app id in the registry. This avoids false-positives with certain anti-virus software.
- Handle sleep/resume events to quickly restore the tunnel when the machine wakes up.
- Add default route to fix NLA issues (Microsoft Store/Office/etc say the machine is offline).
- Update installer to not rely on WMI when enumerating network adapters.
- Increase timeout waiting for OpenVPN to shut down cleanly.
- Sign the bundled openvpn.exe binary. Should make some anti-virus software complain less.


## [2018.5] - 2018-11-15
### Changed
- Replace OpenVPN root CA certificate bundled with the app to the new Mullvad root CA.

### Fixed
#### Linux
- Improve packaging on RPM based distros by re-enabling the daemon after an upgrade


## [2018.5-beta1] - 2018-11-12
### Added
- Fall back and try to connect over TCP port 443 if protocol is set to automatic and two attempts
  with UDP fail in a row. If that also fails, alternate between UDP and TCP with random ports.
- Add new system and in-app notifications to inform the user when the app becomes outdated,
  unsupported or may have security issues.
- Allow the user to view the relay in/out IP address in the GUI.
- Add OpenVPN proxy support via CLI.
- Allow DHCPv6 in the firewall.

### Fixed
- Pick new random relay for each reconnect attempt instead of just retrying with the same one.
- Make the `problem-report` tool fall back to the bundled API IP if DNS resolution fails.

#### macOS
- Correctly backup and restore search domains and other DNS settings.

#### Linux
- Disable GPU acceleration on Linux to fix App on Ubuntu 14.04 and other older distributions.
- Improve DNS management detection. Evaluates which way the system handles DNS before each new
  VPN tunnel is established instead of only on computer boot.
- Set DNS search domain when using the systemd-resolved. Makes it work on Ubuntu 18.10.

#### Windows
- Fix crash on Windows 7 when closing installer.

### Security
#### Linux
- Block all traffic to DNS servers other than the correct one in the tunnel. Stops potential DNS
  leaks when "Local network sharing" was enabled and DNS management failed.


## [2018.4] - 2018-10-16
### Fixed
- Fix so changing the OpenVPN mssfix setting triggers setting up a new tunnel with the new setting.


## [2018.4-beta3] - 2018-10-12
### Fixed
- Place Mssfix setting inside scrollable area.
- Fix so mssfix can be unset. Previously emptying the textbox did nothing.

#### Linux
- The app will have its window resized correctly when display scaling settings are changed. This
  should also fix bad window behaviour on startup.
- Fixed systemd-resolved DNS management. Skip using it as the DNS manager if it's running in
  consumer mode.


## [2018.4-beta2] - 2018-10-08
### Added
- Allow configuration of OpenVPN mssfix option with GUI (under Advanced Settings).

#### Windows
- Monitor and enforce IPv6 DNS settings on network interfaces (previously IPv4-only).

#### Linux
- Add support for DNS configuration using systemd-resolved and NetworkManager.

### Changed
- Auto-hide scrollbars on macOS only, leaving them visible on other platforms.
- Instead of showing the public IP of the device in the UI, we show the hostname of the VPN server
  the app is connected to. Or nothing if not connected anywhere.
- Passing `--connect-timeout 30` to OpenVPN to decrease the time the daemon
  will wait until it tries to reconnect again in the case of a broken TCP connection.
- Increase timeout parameter to OpenVPN from 15 to 20 seconds. Should make active VPN tunnels drop
  less frequent when on unstable networks.
- Reduce the transparency of "blocking internet" banner to increase the text readability.
- Make the quit button visible without needing to scroll down in the settings view.

#### Linux
- Move CLI binary to `/usr/bin/` as to have the CLI binary in the user's `PATH` by default.

### Removed
- Remove `--comp-lzo` argument to OpenVPN. Disables any possibility of establishing a VPN tunnel
  with compression.

### Fixed
#### Windows
- Use different method for identifying network interfaces during installation. Should solve some
  installation errors.
- Properly restore DNS settings on network interfaces. Fixes issue #352.


## [2018.4-beta1] - 2018-10-01
### Added
- Allow packets to the fe80::/10 and fe02::/16 IPv6 networks when local network sharing is enabled.
  Should allow IPv6 over the LAN, and mDNS host discovery which in turn should allow Apple AirDrop
  and Handover among other IPv6 based LAN discovery services.

#### Linux
- Add support for DNS configuration using resolvconf.

### Changed
- Logging in no longer requires a connection with the Mullvad API server.
- Replace repeated `Disconnecting` followed by `Connecting` notifications with a single
  `Reconnecting` notification.

### Fixed
- Don't temporarily show the unsecured state in the GUI when the app is reconnecting or blocking.
- Periodically update list of relays in the GUI.
- Redact IPv6 address that start or end with double colons in problem reports.
- Improve tray icon response time by disabling the double click handling.

### Security
- Prevent Electron from executing/navigating to files being drag-and-dropped onto the app GUI. This
  fixes [MUL-01-001](./audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues)


## [2018.3] - 2018-09-17
### Changed
#### macOS
- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) back into the `Resources/` directory. A bug caused the app to not
  be signed if it was placed in the app root directory.

### Security
#### Windows
- Lock the installation directory to `C:\Program Files\Mullvad VPN`. This prevents potential local
  privilege escalation by ensuring all binaries executed by the `SYSTEM` user, as part of the
  Mullvad system service, are stored where unprivileged users can't modify them. This fixes
  [MUL-01-004](./audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).


## [2018.3-beta1] - 2018-09-13
### Added
- Add option to enable or disable IPv6 on the tunnel interface. It's disabled by default.
- Log panics in the daemon to the log file.
- Warn in the Settings screen if a new version is available.
- Add a "blocked" state in the app that blocks the entire network and shows a message about what
  went wrong. Then it waits for user action.
- Add support for Ubuntu 14.04 and other distributions that use the Upstart init system.
- Make scrollbar thumb draggable.
- Ability to expand cities with multiple servers and configure the app to use a specific server.
- Add firewall rules allowing traffic to the SSDP/WS-discover multicast IP, 239.255.255.250, if
  local area network sharing is activated. This allows discovery of devices using these protocols.

#### macOS
- Add uninstall script that can uninstall and remove all the files installed by the app.

#### Windows
- Extend uninstaller to also remove logs, cache and optionally settings.
- Add installation log (%PROGRAMDATA%\Mullvad VPN\install.log).

### Changed
- The "Buy more credit" button is changed to open a dedicated account login page instead of one
  having a create account form first.
- The CLI command to list relays is now shorter, `mullvad relay list` instead of
  `mullvad relay list locations`.
- Replace WebSockets with Unix domain sockets/Named pipes for IPC. The location
  of the socket can be controlled with `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`.
- Update the relay list if it's out of date when the daemon starts.
- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) on macOS and Linux up one level, so it's installed directly into
  the app installation directory instead of the `resource` directory.

### Fixed
- Fix incorrect window position when using external display.
- Don't auto-connect the daemon on start if no account token is set. This prevents the daemon from
  blocking all internet if logging out from the app.

#### Linux
- The app window is now shown in its previous location, instead of at the center of the screen.
- Remove daemon log, cache and configuration directories during full uninstallation of the app.
- Restart the daemon automatically on upgrade.
- Fix systemd unit file to support older versions of systemd (e.g., in Debian 8).

#### macOS
- Fix edge cases when window's arrow appeared misaligned and pointed to the wrong menubar item.
- Make the pkg installer kill any running GUI process after installation is done. Prevents
  accidentally running an old GUI with a newer daemon.

#### Windows
- Failing to restore DNS settings on daemon start does not make the daemon exit with an error, just
  log the error and continue.


## [2018.2] - 2018-08-13
This release is identical to 2018.2-beta3


## [2018.2-beta3] - 2018-08-09
### Added
- Create a new UI log file for every UI execution session, and preserve the log from the previous
  session.

### Changed
- Format the expiry date and time using the system locale.
- Account tokens are now required to have at least ten digits.

#### macOS
- Rename directores for settings, logs and cache from `mullvad-daemon` to `mullvad-vpn`.

#### Windows
- Use local user directory to store system service settings and GUI electron cache, instead of the
  roaming user directory.
- Where the system service would use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad\Mullvad VPN\` it now just uses
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad VPN\`

### Fixed
- Ignore empty strings as redaction requests in the problem report tool, to avoid adding redacted
  markers between every character of the log message.
- Previously logged in users won't be going through login view when restarting the app, instead
  will be taken straight to main view.


## [2018.2-beta2] - 2018-07-18
### Added
- Bundle the root CA signing the API and only trust that single one, limiting
  trust to a single root CA
- Add a unique UUID to problem reports. Makes it easier for Mullvad support staff to find reports.

  submitted.

#### Windows
- Hide the app icon from taskbar.
- Autohide the main window on focus loss.
- Loosen up firewall rules to allow incoming requests on tunnel interface.

  paths and window captions etc.
- Improve account token hint to be the same length as an expected token.
- Update `problem-report` binary to automatically collect log files in predefined known Mullvad log
  directories.
- Replaced previously bundled OpenVPN 2.4.4 with statically linked 2.4.6 version containing
  Mullvad patches for faster connect and other improvements.
- Increase the OpenVPN receive and send buffers from 524288 to 1048576 bytes (1MiB).
- Make the log, cache, settings and RPC address directories configurable via the following
  environment variables: `MULLVAD_LOG_DIR`, `MULLVAD_CACHE_DIR`, `MULLVAD_SETTINGS_DIR` and
  `MULLVAD_RPC_ADDRESS_PATH`.

#### macOS
- The installer changed from dmg to pkg format.
- The daemon is installed as a launchd daemon and started on install and on boot.

## [2018.1] - 2018-03-01
### Changed
- Redact all account numbers in the account number history from problem reports instead of only the
  currently logged in one.

### Fixed
- Increase a timeout for problem report collection to fix a timeout error on slower machines.
- Fix a memory leak in the problem report collection routine.
- Fix an issue when viewing a problem report brought up a dialog to choose the application to open
  the file.


## [2018.1-beta10] - 2018-02-13

### Fixed
- Fix erroneous styles in the settings view.

### Security
- Update the CRL with newly revoked server certificates.


## [2018.1-beta9] - 2018-01-30
### Added
- Uses the https://am.i.mullvad.net/ service to figure out location and public IP of the device.
  The app then shows this information in the unsecured state.
- Argument to the daemon, `--resource-dir <path>`, that allows customizing where it will look for
  needed resource files.
- A very stylish map now indicates where you are connecting through.

  of servers is automatically updated when the app starts.
- The location selector now shows if the country or city has any active servers.

### Changed
- The tray icon now indicates whether the app is allowing traffic outside the tunnel or not. If the
  app blocks traffic because the tunnel is not connected the tray icon will indicate this with a
