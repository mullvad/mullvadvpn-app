# Changelog
All changes to the software that can be noticed from the users' perspective should have an entry in
this file. Except very minor things that will not affect functionality, such as log message changes
and minor GUI adjustments.

### Format

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Entries should have the imperative form, just like commit messages. Start each entry with words like
add, fix, increase, force etc.. Not added, fixed, increased, forced etc.

Line wrap the file at 100 chars.                                              That is over here -> |

## [2018.1-beta9] - 2018-01-30

  The app then shows this information in the unsecured state.

## [2018.1-beta8] - 2018-01-09

  networks: 10/8, 192.168/16 and 172.16/12) while the app is in the secured state.

  of servers is automatically updated when the app starts.
- The location selector now shows if the country or city has any active servers.

### Changed

  app blocks traffic because the tunnel is not connected the tray icon will indicate this with a

  the logs are sent.

  completely disconnected.

### Changed
- Renamed daemon binary from `mullvadd` to `mullvad-daemon`.

### Security
