### Added
- Handle "block when disconnected" extra kill-switch level in the GUI, showing the disconnected
  state as blocked when appropriate and also having a toggle switch for the setting in the Advanced
  Settings screen.
- Add a drop-down warning to notify the user when the account credits are running low.
- Allow the 169.254.0.0/16 private network in addition to the other networks allowed when local

  initially visible.

### Changed
- Disable buttons and menus that open external links when the app knows that there is no internet
  connection.

  configures the GUI to automatically connect when it starts and so that it will only auto-connect
  on boot when both settings are set.

### Fixed
- Stop GUI from glitching during the short reconnect state.
- Dismiss notifications automatically after four seconds in all platforms.
- Fix error printed from the CLI when issuing `relay update`.
- Fix relay list update interval. Should now handle sleep better.
- Prevent GUI from sending connect commands to the daemon every time it establishes a connection to
  it. Only send connect once (if auto-connect is enabled.)
- Prevent possible reconnect loop where the GUI would indefinitely reconnect to the daemon.
- Fix the bug which enabled users to return to the login view if they went to settings while
  logging in.
- Handle in the GUI, if something external changes the account token in the daemon. I.e. triggered
  by CLI unsetting or resetting it.

#### Linux
- Fix Debian package not upgrading properly due to a bug in the post-remove script.
- Wait for NetworkManager and systemd-resolved services to start before daemon starts on platforms
  with systemd and those two services. Prevents the daemon from using the wrong DNS API.

#### Windows
- Gracefully block when TAP adapter is missing or disabled, instead of retrying to connect.

### Security
#### Linux
- Poll netfilter to verify firewall rules were added correctly. On Ubuntu 14.04 netfilter did not
  return any error, but it also ignored the rules the daemon tried to add.


## [2018.6] - 2018-12-12
This release is identical to 2018.6-beta1


## [2018.6-beta1] - 2018-12-05
### Added
- CLI command `relay update` that triggers an update of the relay list in the daemon.

  internet directly after the app says it's connected.
- Disable keep alive on API RPC requests. Should stop reuse of invalid sockets after tunnel state
  changes.

#### macOS
- Fix permissions on log dir so problem-report tool has permission to read daemon logs.

#### Windows
- Use proper app id in the registry. This avoids false-positives with certain anti-virus software.

#### Windows
- Fix crash on Windows 7 when closing installer.

### Security
#### Linux
- Block all traffic to DNS servers other than the correct one in the tunnel. Stops potential DNS
  leaks when "Local network sharing" was enabled and DNS management failed.


## [2018.4] - 2018-10-16
### Fixed
- Fix so changing the OpenVPN mssfix setting triggers setting up a new tunnel with the new setting.


## [2018.4-beta3] - 2018-10-12
### Fixed
- Place Mssfix setting inside scrollable area.
- Fix so mssfix can be unset. Previously emptying the textbox did nothing.

#### Linux
- The app will have its window resized correctly when display scaling settings are changed. This
  should also fix bad window behaviour on startup.

#### Linux
- Move CLI binary to `/usr/bin/` as to have the CLI binary in the user's `PATH` by default.

### Removed
- Remove `--comp-lzo` argument to OpenVPN. Disables any possibility of establishing a VPN tunnel
  with compression.

### Fixed
#### Windows
- Use different method for identifying network interfaces during installation. Should solve some
  installation errors.
- Properly restore DNS settings on network interfaces. Fixes issue #352.


## [2018.4-beta1] - 2018-10-01
### Added
- Allow packets to the fe80::/10 and fe02::/16 IPv6 networks when local network sharing is enabled.
  Should allow IPv6 over the LAN, and mDNS host discovery which in turn should allow Apple AirDrop
  and Handover among other IPv6 based LAN discovery services.

#### Linux

## [2018.3] - 2018-09-17
### Changed
#### macOS
- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) back into the `Resources/` directory. A bug caused the app to not
  be signed if it was placed in the app root directory.

### Security
#### Windows
- Lock the installation directory to `C:\Program Files\Mullvad VPN`. This prevents potential local
  privilege escalation by ensuring all binaries executed by the `SYSTEM` user, as part of the
  Mullvad system service, are stored where unprivileged users can't modify them. This fixes
  [MUL-01-004](./audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).


## [2018.3-beta1] - 2018-09-13

  local area network sharing is activated. This allows discovery of devices using these protocols.

#### macOS
- Add uninstall script that can uninstall and remove all the files installed by the app.

#### Windows
- Extend uninstaller to also remove logs, cache and optionally settings.
- Add installation log (%PROGRAMDATA%\Mullvad VPN\install.log).

### Changed
- The "Buy more credit" button is changed to open a dedicated account login page instead of one
  having a create account form first.
- The CLI command to list relays is now shorter, `mullvad relay list` instead of
  `mullvad relay list locations`.
- Replace WebSockets with Unix domain sockets/Named pipes for IPC. The location
  of the socket can be controlled with `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`.
- Update the relay list if it's out of date when the daemon starts.
- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) on macOS and Linux up one level, so it's installed directly into
  the app installation directory instead of the `resource` directory.

### Fixed
- Fix incorrect window position when using external display.
- Don't auto-connect the daemon on start if no account token is set. This prevents the daemon from
  blocking all internet if logging out from the app.

#### Linux
- The app window is now shown in its previous location, instead of at the center of the screen.
- Remove daemon log, cache and configuration directories during full uninstallation of the app.
- Restart the daemon automatically on upgrade.

#### macOS
- Fix edge cases when window's arrow appeared misaligned and pointed to the wrong menubar item.
- Make the pkg installer kill any running GUI process after installation is done. Prevents
  accidentally running an old GUI with a newer daemon.

#### Windows
- Failing to restore DNS settings on daemon start does not make the daemon exit with an error, just
  log the error and continue.


## [2018.2] - 2018-08-13
This release is identical to 2018.2-beta3


## [2018.2-beta3] - 2018-08-09

  markers between every character of the log message.
- Previously logged in users won't be going through login view when restarting the app, instead
  will be taken straight to main view.

## [2018.1] - 2018-03-01
### Changed
- Redact all account numbers in the account number history from problem reports instead of only the
  currently logged in one.

### Fixed
- Increase a timeout for problem report collection to fix a timeout error on slower machines.
- Fix a memory leak in the problem report collection routine.
- Fix an issue when viewing a problem report brought up a dialog to choose the application to open
  the file.


## [2018.1-beta10] - 2018-02-13
### Added
- Show the app version in the settings view.

### Changed
- Require confirmation when sending problem reports without an email address.

### Fixed
- Fix erroneous styles in the settings view.

### Security
- Update the CRL with newly revoked server certificates.


## [2018.1-beta9] - 2018-01-30
### Added
- Uses the https://am.i.mullvad.net/ service to figure out location and public IP of the device.
  The app then shows this information in the unsecured state.
- Argument to the daemon, `--resource-dir <path>`, that allows customizing where it will look for
  needed resource files.
- A very stylish map now indicates where you are connecting through.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the problem report tool would redact some things in the logs which were not
  IPv6 addresses, but looked like ones.
- Show a better error message when api.mullvad.net is unreachable.
- Fix bug getting daemon state on frontend start instead of assuming it.


## [2018.1-beta8] - 2018-01-09
### Added
- "Allow LAN" setting that configures if the app should allow communication to the LAN (private
  networks: 10/8, 192.168/16 and 172.16/12) while the app is in the secured state.
- The app can now be used to connect to all our servers rather than a smaller subset. The list
  of servers is automatically updated when the app starts.
- The location selector now shows if the country or city has any active servers.

### Changed
- The tray icon now indicates whether the app is allowing traffic outside the tunnel or not. If the
  app blocks traffic because the tunnel is not connected the tray icon will indicate this with a
  green lock with a red dot.

- Download a list of our current servers on startup, instead of having a bundled list of servers in
  the app that does not receive updates.
- Backup account numbers in a file so that they are harder to lose.
- Include the OpenVPN log in the problem report. IP addresses and MAC addresses are redacted before
  the logs are sent.

### Fixed
- Hold off notifying the frontend of the 'unsecure' state until the VPN tunnel is actually
  completely disconnected.
- Show the VPN GUI on all macOS workspaces, not only the one where it was started.

### Changed
- Renamed daemon binary from `mullvadd` to `mullvad-daemon`.

### Security
- DNS leak found when using redirect firewall rules and a custom DNS forwarder. Replaced all of that
  with strict DNS blocking firewall rules and SystemConfiguration integration where DNS settings are
  injected to the operating system settings and constantly monitored for external changes.


## [2017.1-beta6] - 2017-11-09
