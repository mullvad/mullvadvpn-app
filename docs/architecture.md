# Mullvad VPN app architecture

This document describes the code architecture and how everything fits together.

For security and anonymity properties, please see [security](security.md).

Some components have specific documentation that go into greater detail:

## Mullvad vs talpid

Explain the differences between these layers and why the distinction exists.
My thought was that after this section every aspect of the app is explained
under either the Mullvad or the Talpid header. So it's clear which part they
belong to. I yet don't know if this makes sense though.


## Mullvad part of daemon

### Frontend <-> system service communication

### Talking to api.mullvad.net

### Tunnel state machine

The tunnel state machine is the part of Talpid that coordinates the events for establishing a VPN
connection. It acts upon requests for establishing a secure VPN connection or for disconnecting an
already established connection and returning the system to its initial state. This involves also
using other parts of Talpid to configure the system so that the security policies are applied and
so that the connection works correctly without any further manual configuration necessary.

The tunnel state machine starts in an initial `Disconnected` state. In this state, no changes are
made to the operating system and no security policies are applied. When a request is sent to the
state machine to establish a connection, the state machine will progress first into a `Connecting`
state that will configure the operating system and setup a tunnel with a connection to a VPN server.
Once the configuration is complete and the connection is verified to be working, the state machine
then proceeds to a `Connected` state.

A request can be made to close the VPN connection. Such request will lead the state machine into
a `Disconnecting` state, which will close the connection to the VPN server and restore the operating
system to its original configuration. After the process is complete, the state machine returns to
the `Disconnected` state.

If an error occurs in the `Connecting` or `Connected` states, the state machine may proceed to an
`Error` state. It might reach this state either immediately (when an error occurs in the
`Connecting` state) or after passing through another state to tear down the tunnel (when an error
occurs in the `Connected` state). Either way, in this state the operating system is configured to
block all connections to avoid leaking any data. The objective is to ensure no data leaks from the
tunnel while the user has requested a secure connection, as defined in the [security document].

A high-level overview of the tunnel state machine can be seen in the diagram below:

#### State machine inputs

There are two types of inputs that the tunnel state machine react to. The first one is commands sent
to the state machine, and the second is external events that the state machine listens to.

##### Tunnel commands

Besides the two main commands `Connect` and `Disconnect`, there are a few other commands that can be
sent to the tunnel state machine. The following list includes all the commands the tunnel state
machine can receive.

- *Connect*: establish a secure VPN connection
- *Disconnect*: tear down the active VPN connection and return the operating system to its initial
  configuration
- *Allow LAN*: enable or disable local network sharing, changing the security policies for some of
  the states
- *Block when disconnected*: configures whether the state machine should apply the security policy
  for blocking all connections when it's in the `Disconnected` state, effectively requesting the
  system to never allow connections outside the tunnel

##### External events

Depending on the state of the machine, it will also listen for specific external events and act
on them possibly by changing states. All of these events can be considered as tunnel events, but
they happen on different scenarios and because of different causes.

- *Tunnel is Up*: the tunnel monitor notifies that the tunnel is working correctly
- *Tunnel is Down*: the tunnel monitor notifies that the tunnel has disconnected
- *Tunnel monitor stopped*: communication to the tunnel monitor was lost
- *Is offline*: notify the tunnel state machine if the operating system is connected or not to the
  network, so that it can safely wait for connectivity to be restored without endlessly retrying to
  establish the VPN connection

#### State machine outputs

Every time the state machine changes state, it will output a `TunnelStateTransition`. This is an
`enum` type representing which state the tunnel state machine has entered and any associated
metadata that might be useful.

- *Disconnected*
- *Connecting*: includes the information of the endpoint it is trying to connect to
- *Connected*: includes the information of the endpoint it is connected to
- *Disconnecting*: includes the state it will transition to once successfully disconnected, which
  is represented as the action it will take after disconnected, listed below:
  - *Nothing*: proceed to the `Disconnected` state
  - *Block*: proceed to the `Error` state
  - *Reconnect*: proceed to the `Connecting` state
- *Error*: includes the cause of the error and the information if the operating system was
  successfully configured to block all connections
