# The reason why we check for vendorability is not because we at Mullvad usually vendor
# dependencies ourselves. But it can help some third party packagers of this project.
# It also is a sanity check on our dependency tree. Vendoring will fail if a single
# dependency has multiple sources: https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/issues/4848
