      # The reason why we check for vendorability is not because we at Mullvad usually vendor
      # dependencies ourselves. But it can help some third party packagers of this project.
      # It also is a sanity check on our dependency tree. Vendoring will fail if a single
      # dependency has multiple sources: https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/issues/4848
