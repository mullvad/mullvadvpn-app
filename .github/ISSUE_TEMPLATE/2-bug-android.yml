        If you ran into a problem with the app and don't know for sure it is an actual bug,
        please contact support instead of filing a bug report. Go to `Settings -> Support -> Report a problem`.
        That way the support team gets redacted logs from your app and can help you out better.
        You can also just email them at support@mullvad.net.

        - label: I know this is an issue with the app, and contacting Mullvad support is not relevant.
