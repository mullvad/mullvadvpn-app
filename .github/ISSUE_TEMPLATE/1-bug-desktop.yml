        If you ran into a problem with the app and don't know for sure it is an actual bug,
        please contact support instead of filing a bug report. Go to
        `Settings (cogwheel) -> Support -> Report a problem`.
        That way the support team gets redacted logs from your app and can help you out better.
        You can also just email them at support@mullvad.net.
      options:
        - label: I know this is an issue with the app, and contacting Mullvad support is not relevant.

        to see if it has already been reported by others. If so, please comment in those threads instead
        of creating new ones.

        If relevant, please include logs from the app from the time around when the bug manifested itself.

        Go to settings (cogwheel) -> Support -> Report a problem -> View app logs to see the logs and
        copy them to here.

        If the graphical part of the app does not work, you can get the logs via the terminal/console
        by running this command:
        ```
        mullvad-problem-report collect --output mullvad-report.log
        ```
        And then copy the text from the file `mullvad-report.log` that was just created.
