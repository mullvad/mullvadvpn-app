# The app does not depend on maybenot-ffi itself, but adds it as a dependency to expose FFI symbols to wireguard-go.
# This is done, instead of using the makefile in wireguard-go to build maybenot-ffi into its archive, to prevent
# name clashes induced by link-time optimization.
# NOTE: the version of maybenot-ffi below must be the same as the version checked into the wireguard-go submodule
maybenot-ffi = "1.0.0"
