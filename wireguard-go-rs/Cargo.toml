# On platforms where maybenot and wireguard-go can be built statically (Linux and macOS) we use
# this hack to include it. The hack is that we depend on this crate here even if neither
# wireguard-go-rs nor its upstream dependants use it.
# This is only here so that maybenot-ffi is built and its symbols are available to wireguard-go
# at link time.
